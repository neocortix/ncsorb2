  This simple python-oriented example does a small loadtest using a command based on the orb.
  To use this orb, you need to define a $NCS_AUTH_TOKEN environment variable.
usage:
  jobs:
    build:
      docker:
        - image: circleci/python:3.6  # python 3.6.x is required for this example
      steps:
        - checkout

        - ncsorb2/loadtest:
            targetHostUrl: "https://www.example.com"
            nWorkers: 3
            susTime: 15
