  This mainstream example does a small loadtest using a workflow with a job based on the orb.
  To use this orb, you need to define a $NCS_AUTH_TOKEN environment variable.
usage:
  jobs:
    build:
      docker: 
        - image: circleci/node:10  # or any executor you like
      steps:
        - checkout # check out the code in the project directory
        - run: echo your BUILD code here
  workflows:
    version: 2
    build_and_test:
      jobs:
        - build
        - ncsorb2/loadtest:
            requires:
              - build
            targetHostUrl: "https://www.example.com"
            nWorkers: 3
            susTime: 30
